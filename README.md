# TypeScripting

An example of how TypeScript can be transpiled into ES5 compatible JavaScript
and then run in VS Code with breakpoints using the Node debugger and source maps
to stop at lines of code in the TypeScript source files.

Organizing code into modules and classes and having type support allows for
better features in an IDE while also making code which is compatible with
modern web browsers.
